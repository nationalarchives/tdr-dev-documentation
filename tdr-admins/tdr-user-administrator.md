## Managing Transferring Body Users

### Adding a new transferring body

If a new user belongs to a new transferring body not already added to Keycloak, then:
1. Go to the "Groups" page: ![](images/tdr-user-administrator/adding_new_transferring_body/groups_1.png)
2. Click on the "tdr_transferring_body" group so that it is highlighted: ![](images/tdr-user-administrator/adding_new_transferring_body/groups_2.png)
3. Click "new"
4. The "Create Group" page will open: ![](images/tdr-user-administrator/adding_new_transferring_body/groups_3.png)
5. Enter the name of the new transferring body
6. Click "save": ![](images/tdr-user-administrator/adding_new_transferring_body/groups_4.png)
7. On the new group's page go to the attributes tab
8. Enter a new "body" attribute:
  * In the "key" field enter: body
  * In the "value" field enter the code of the transferring body
    * This must match the `TdrCode` field added to the `Body` table in the database, so coordinate this change with the development team. It should begin with `TDR-`, e.g. `TDR-MOJ` or `TDR-WA`. We use the `TDR-` prefix to make it clear that the codes don't necessarily match departmental codes used in other catalogues.
9. Click the "add" button under the "actions" column
10. Then click "save": ![](images/tdr-user-administrator/adding_new_transferring_body/groups_5.png)

2. Click `Save`
