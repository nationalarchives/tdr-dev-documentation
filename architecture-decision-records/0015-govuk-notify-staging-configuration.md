# 15. GovUK Notify Staging Service made Live

**Date:** 2021-04-08

## Context

GovUK Notify is used as the email provider for Keycloak: [0012 Keycloak Email Provider](0012-keycloak-email-provider.md)

## Decision

The "staging" GovUK Notify service is to be live to allow for user testing on this environment. 

Also, it will mirror the TDR production environment as closely as possible.
