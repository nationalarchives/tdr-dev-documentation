# New starters

## Essential setup

- Install [git secrets](git-secrets.md). You **must** do this before working on
  TDR code changes, and when you switch to a new computer.

## Accounts and access

- To access the AWS environments, follow the "Access TDR AWS accounts as a
  developer" guide in the [internal developer manual on Sharepoint][sharepoint-dev-manual]
- To access the TDR GitHub repos, ask an admin of The National Archives' GitHub
  organisation to add you to the Transfer Digital Records team
