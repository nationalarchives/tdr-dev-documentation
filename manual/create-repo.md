# Create a repo

* Create a repo in <https://github.com/nationalarchives>
  * The repo should be public unless you have a [good reason to make it
    closed][open-code]
  * The repo name should start with "tdr-", unless it's going to be used more
    widely
* Update the repo's settings:
  * In "Manage access":
    * give **write** access to the "Transfer Digital Records" team
    * give **admin** access to the "Transfer Digital Records Admins" team
  * In "Options", check "Automatically delete head branches"
  * In "Branch", add a branch protection rule for the *master* branch with the following options selected:
    * **Branch name pattern**: master
    * **Require pull request reviews before merging** *(default 1 review is OK)*
    * **Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed**
    * **Include administrators**
    * **Restrict who can push to matching branches** *(**do not** specify any members for this option)*
* Add an open source licence
  * For code repos, add an MIT licence ([example][mvc-licence])
  * For documentation, add an MIT licence for the code and an [Open Government
    Licence][ogl] for the content. See this repo's LICENCE file the licence note
    in the README for an example.
* Add a link from the new project's README to this documentation, to add context
  for anyone who finds the project
* Add the new project to the repo list in the README of this project
