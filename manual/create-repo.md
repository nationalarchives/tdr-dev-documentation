# Create a repo

## 1. Create Repo on GitHub

Create a repo in <https://github.com/nationalarchives> by clicking the "New" button

* The repo name should start with "tdr-", unless it's going to be used more widely
* The repo should be public unless you have a [good reason to make it closed][open-code]
* Click "Create Repository"

## 2. Add a README

On the next page, steps should appear for how to create a repo via the command line, if they do follow those
instructions, if not, follow these instructions:

1. create a directory locally using the same name as you gave the repo (the one that starts with "tdr-")
2. `echo "# {name of repo}" >> README.md`
3. git init
4. git add README.md
5. git commit -m "Initial commit"
6. git branch -M main
7. git remote add origin `git@github.com:nationalarchives/{name of repo}.git`
8. git push -u origin main

## 3. Add a licence

In the parent directory add an open source licence with the name "licence"

* For code repos, add an MIT licence ([example][mvc-licence])
    * Make sure that the year specified is the current one
* For documentation, add an MIT licence for the code and an [Open Government Licence][ogl] for the content. See this
  repo's LICENCE file the licence note in the README for an example.

## 4. Add a config file

**If** the project contains a [dependabot supported package manager][supported-package-managers] then add
a [dependabot config file][dependabot-config]
to the `workflows` folder in the `.github` folder (create a .github folder if one doesn't exist). If the project doesn't
contain a dependabot supported package manager then skip this step.

## 5. Choose the correct settings for the repo

### 5a. Add teams

Once in the repo, click the "Settings" button (at the top) to update the repo's settings:

* Under "Collaborators and teams" you should see "Manage access":
* Select "Add teams"
    * in the search bar, type "Transfer Digital Records" and select it when it appears
        * give **write** access to this team
        * click the green "Add" button to add it
    * in the search bar, type "Transfer Digital Records Admins" and select it when it appears
        * give **admin** access to this team
        * click the green "Add" button to add it

### 5b. Automatically delete head branches

Go to "General" settings (as the top), and scroll down to "Automatically delete head branches" and select this

### 5c. Set rules for main branch

* In "Branches", you should see the "main" branch.
* Under "Branch protection rules" select "Add rule"
* For the "Branch name pattern", add the name "main"
* Select the following branch protection rule options for *main*:
    * **Require pull request reviews before merging**
        * "Require approvals" should be selected automatically which is fine *(the default of 1 required number of
          approvals is OK)*
    * **Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed**
    * For any repositories that use a multi-branch GitHub Actions pipeline the following additional branch protection
      rules should be set for the *main* rule:
        * **Require status checks to pass before merging**
            * **Require branches to be up-to-date before merging** *(sub option)*
                * **Note**: the GitHub Actions job will need to be configured first before this status check will
                  appear.
    * **Require signed commits**
    * **Include administrators**
* Click the "Save changes" button

### 6. Add workflow files

* In the repo, if there isn't a `.github` directory create one
* Within that `.github` directory, create a `workflows` directory
* copy the `build.yml`, `deploy.yml` and `test.yml` from a similar repo ([example][example-repo-workflow-files])
* For the build.yml
    * replace all instances of the older repo's name with the name of your repo
    * under `pre-deploy: > uses` change the [workflow][workflow-files] to the "build" workflow relevant for your repo
    * change the build command to run whatever commands the project needs to build
* For the deploy.yml
    * under `deploy: > uses` change the [workflow][workflow-files] to the "deploy" workflow relevant for your repo
* For the test.yml
    * under `jobs: > test: > with: > test-command: >` change the build test-commands to run whatever commands the
      project needs to test its code
* Once this is done, commit the files and push them to the repo; you will notice that the test job will start running
    * **Note**: In order to push to the repo, you'll need to create a new branch

### 7. Select status checks that are required before merging

* Go back to the repo and select the "Settings"
* Select "Branches"
* Under "Require branches to be up to date before merging" (that you selected previously), you should now see a search
  bar with the placeholder text "Search for status checks in the last week for this repository"
* type in "test / test" and select that status check option

### 8. Remove yourself from list of who can manage access

* Go to the "Settings"
* Under In the "Manage access" section, you should see your account that has been given admin
* Next to your account, Click "remove"
    * *Since you are either a part of the "Transfer Digital Records" or "Transfer Digital Records Admins", you will
      still be able to at least write to this repo*

### 9. Link other repos to project

* Add a link from the new project's README to this documentation, to add context for anyone who finds the project
* Add the new project to the repo list in the README of **this** project
* If the project is a Scala project, add the repository to the [list of repos maintained by Scala Steward]
