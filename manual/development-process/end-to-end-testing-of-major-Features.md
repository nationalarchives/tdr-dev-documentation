# Development Process Documentation: End-to-End Testing of Major Features

## Overview
This document outlines the process to be followed after the implementation of a major feature in our development lifecycle. It ensures that the feature is thoroughly tested in a collaborative environment to validate that it meets the business requirements and to identify any potential issues or improvements.
This end-to-end testing process involves the entire development team, including developers, UX/UI designers, product managers, and other relevant stakeholders.

## Purpose
The primary objective of this process is to:
- Verify that the implemented feature aligns with the specified requirements.
- Ensure that the feature works seamlessly within the overall system.
- Detect any bugs, usability issues, or potential enhancements that could improve the feature's performance or user experience.
- Foster collaboration between different team members to leverage diverse perspectives.

## Scope
This process applies to all major feature releases or significant updates to existing functionality. A major feature is defined as any feature that significantly impacts the product's core functionality, user experience, or business logic.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### 1. **Session Runner**
- Lead the testing process by developing end-to-end test scenarios.
- Try out suggestions by others during the meeting
- Validate that the feature functions as intended across all edge cases and use cases.

### 2. **Developers**
- Implement the feature as per the specification and design requirements.
- Conduct initial unit tests to ensure core functionality works.
- Participate in the end-to-end testing process to gain feedback and answer technical questions.

### 3. **Product Managers**
- Ensure the feature meets business requirements and user needs.
- Provide clarifications on feature requirements or adjustments.
- Identify any potential enhancements based on testing results.

### 4. **UX/UI Designers**
- Review the user interface and user experience aspects.
- Ensure the feature aligns with the overall product design standards.
- Suggest potential improvements for better usability.

### 5. **User Researches & Stakeholders/Users (if needed)**
- Provide feedback based on real-world usage scenarios.
- Identify any usability issues or gaps in functionality from a user perspective.

## Process Workflow

### Step 1: **Preparation for End-to-End Testing**
- The session runner prepares detailed test scenarios and test cases for the new feature, covering all possible use cases, edge cases, and expected outcomes.
- Ensure the feature is deployed on an environment and set up so that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible to ensure reliable results.
- A testing plan is shared with the entire team, specifying the date and time for the collaborative testing session.

### Step 3: **Collaborative End-to-End Testing Session**
- The entire team, including developers, UI/UX designers, product managers, and any other relevant stakeholders, participate in the testing session.
- **Testing Focus**:
  - **Functionality**: Does the feature work as intended? Are all user flows smooth and intuitive?
  - **Performance**: Does the feature operate efficiently within the system without causing slowdowns or bottlenecks?
  - **User Experience**: Is the design intuitive? Are there any areas where the user might encounter confusion or friction?
  - **Edge Cases**: What happens when the feature is used in less typical ways (e.g., invalid inputs, unexpected user behavior)?
  - **Compatibility**: Does the feature work across different devices, browsers, or platforms (if applicable)?
  - **Integration**: If feature is part of another process/feature. Does the new feature integrate properly with other existing features or systems?

### Step 4: **Feedback and Issue Documentation**
- As issues or improvement areas are identified during testing, they are documented in the project management tool (e.g., Jira, Trello) or a shared document.
- Each item should include:
  - A description of the issue or suggestion.
  - The severity (critical, high, medium, low).
  - Steps to reproduce (if it's a bug).
  - Any relevant screenshots or logs.
  - Assigned owner for resolution.

### Step 5: **Issue Prioritisation and Resolution**
- After the testing session, the team will prioritise the identified issues and improvements based on their impact and urgency.
- Some non-critical issues or enhancements may be scheduled for future releases, depending on project timelines.

### Step 6: **Retesting (If applicable)**
- Once the identified issues are resolved, the QA team and developers perform targeted retesting to ensure the fixes work and have not introduced new issues.
- If major changes are made, another end-to-end testing session may be required before the feature is considered complete.

## Conclusion
The end-to-end testing process is a critical stage in the development of major features, ensuring that the product meets the required standards for functionality, usability, and performance. By involving the entire team in this process, we ensure a higher-quality output and provide opportunities for collaborative problem-solving and improvements before the feature is released to users.
