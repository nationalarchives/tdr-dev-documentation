# Choices for the authentication/authorization for TDR

## Context
This is about the choice we have for authentication and authorisation within the TDR web app and authentication for other services which carry out processing on the data. 
As always, we have consulted the [gds guidance].

Cognito is an AWS service which provides authentication and authorisation. 
Silhouette is a Scala library which allows you to add authentication and authorisation to a Play MVC app. 

Our first prototype was a single page application using Cognito for authorisation. For a single page app, Cognito is a good choice. We can use the full featured javascript API to sign in, all of the tokens are stored in cookies and in local storage within the browser and all calls are made out to API gateway directly from the front end.
 The [getting started] page for Cognito lists sample apps for IOS, Android and an Angular single page app which suggests that these are the main use cases for Cognito.

Our second prototype however is no longer a single page app. We are following the GDS recommended strategy of progressive enhancement which means that the site needs to work without javascript wherever possible and this includes the sign in functionality. We also have back end processing tasks communicating with the API which weren't present in the original prototype which have no concept of a user and so can't use Cognito for authentication.

We have then looked into a few other options, like Auth0 one of the leaders in  Identity-as-a-Service and KeyCloak, open source Identity and Access Management solution
that needs to be self hosted.
The below table lists some comparisons between these approaches. They're based around three rough criteria: 
* How easy it is to integrate with other services, either the gradated access service or another cloud provider.
* How easy it is to develop and maintain. 
* How usable is it. 

Some considerations about different choices for the TDR authorization and authentication implementation

We have chosen to start our beta product using KeyCloak.
Although KeyCloak scores the most, we have used the scores just for information and we acknowledge that they are subjective and based on limited information and research.
The main advantages of KeyCloak are:
- well known, tested solution
- open source, we don't have hidden possible costs
- used by other government departments, so we can reuse some addons they have built (like text messages for MFA)
