# Technology considerations

Results of investigations into different technology choices for TDR.

These docs cover technical spikes, open-ended investigations and comparisons
between different tools. A lot of them happened in the Alpha development phase.
For decisions that we're taking forward into the Beta and Live phases, see the
[architecture decision records](../architecture-decision-records/README.md).
